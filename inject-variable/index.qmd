Most JavaScript libraries work just fine in OJS. But for a current project I want to use a framework that needs to be loaded in vanilla JavaScript (because we want to make a Quarto extension that uses it, and we can't inject OJS code into a Quarto doc without considerable work).

The library has a constructor function, and the object it sends back can be configured to have callbacks that respond to browser events. I want to rig those callbacks so that they update an OJS variableâ€”that way, users of our extension can access its state and use it to drive visualisations.

So the question is, can we declare and update an OJS variable from vanilla JavaScript?

I can see that `window._ojs` exists, and that `window._ojs.ojsConnector` has a `mainModule` that appears to (further down) contain variables being declared in my OJS blocks. For example, here's an OJS variable, 'myMessage':

```{ojs}
myMessage = 23
```

if I run this vanilla JS in the browser devtools:

```js
const ojsVars = window._ojs.ojsConnector.mainModule._scope.entries()
const var1 = ojsVars.next().value

var1[0]
// "myMessage" 

var1[1]._value
// 23
```

Great! There may be a problem checking that the runtime and module have loaded, but we can at least see it.

The [OJS runtime docs](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime/blob/v3.0.5/README.md) describe the process of attaching a variable to a _module_ (which is a namespace for variables), and a module to a _runtime_ (an instance of OJS, I think) as something like:

```js
const runtime = new Runtime(builtins);
const module = runtime.module();
const a = module.variable();
// define as a constant
a.define("foo", 42);

// define another variable that takes an argument
const b = module.variable();
b.define(["foo"], foo => foo * 2);
```
